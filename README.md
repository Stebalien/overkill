Overkill
========

A pub-sub framework written in python for processing data from multiple sources.

Why
---

I needed a status bar generation program. Overkill can listen on multiple system
data sources (pipes, watched directories, timers, etc.), and forward this
information on to data processors. On my system, these data processors pipe the
provided data to my status bar and to notifications (for email).

TODO: Document more.
